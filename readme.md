Browser.js is an attempt to write a complete browser in Javascript.  The goal is not to create a browser for end users or to make something super performant, though down the road that'd be fantastic.  Rather, the goal is to build a standards-compliant browser in a high-level language, where the functionality is clear, enabling a deeper understanding of how browsers actually work.
